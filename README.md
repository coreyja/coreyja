Pronouns: He/Him

Welcome to my Github profile!

Hey! I'm Corey, a web developer and content creator. I'm passionate about Rust programming and love sharing my knowledge and experience through my videos and streams. My goal is to create educational and engaging content that developers of all skill levels can enjoy. Whether you're just starting out or an experienced pro, I hope you'll find something useful in my videos. I also have a Discord server where viewers are welcome to join, ask questions, provide feedback, and hang out with me and the community. I'm always open to feedback and suggestions, so please don't hesitate to reach out and let me know what you'd like to see from me. Thanks for stopping by!

I'm currently working on a few exciting projects, including my Battlesnake AI and an Advent of Code video series. I'm also planning to create a course on building an HTTP framework from the ground up in Rust.

These projects allow me to combine my passion for Rust programming with my love of creating educational content. I hope you'll join me in following my progress and learning something new along the way!
