### ðŸ‘‹  Hey I'm Corey

Pronouns: He/Him

I'm a Web Developer who is trying out content creation!<br />
I'm streaming on Twitch: https://twitch.tv/coreyja<br />
and starting to make videos for Youtube: https://www.youtube.com/@Coreyja<br />
Also check out my blog at https://coreyja.com<br />
And my Fediverse account at: <a rel="me" href="https://toot.cat/@Coreyja">https://toot.cat/@Coreyja</a> - `@coreyja@toot.cat`<br />

Just about all the coding I do on stream and for my Youtube Channel is open source and on my Github Profile

One of the things I've been doing a lot recently is Battlesnake: https://play.battlesnake.com
Every Sunday you can tune into my Twitch where we will work on my Snakes AI and various other Battlesnake topics

I have a Discord Server that I am starting out that is open for everyone!

### Sponsorship

If you like the content I produce and want to see me make more, I'd love a Sponsorship on Github Sponsors!
All Sponsors have my eternal gratitude and those who join the Discord Server will get a special role and access to some private Sponsor-only channels!
