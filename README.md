### ðŸ‘‹  Hey I'm Corey

Pronouns: He/Him

I'm a Web Developer who is trying out content creation!

I'm streaming on Twitch: https://twitch.tv/coreyja
and starting to make videos for Youtube: https://www.youtube.com/@Coreyja
Also check out my blog at https://coreyja.com

Just about all the coding I do on stream and for my Youtube Channel is open source and on my Github Profile

One of the things I've been doing a lot recently is Battlesnake: https://play.battlesnake.com
Every Sunday you can tune into my Twitch where we will work on my Snakes AI and various other Battlesnake topics

I have a Discord that I am starting out that is open for everyone! Sponsors will get a special role and access to some private Sponsor-only channels!
